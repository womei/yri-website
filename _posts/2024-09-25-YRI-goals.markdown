YRI is a faction for the [TU Delft Works Council](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/about-tu-delft/organisation/consultation-bodies/ondernemingsraad) founded in 2023. We aim to support Young Researchers (PhDs, Post Docs, and other early career researchers) by ensuring a safe, fair, and meaningful work environment for all employees.

Specifically, we aim to:

- **Improve the work-life balance** of all employees by ensuring that the TU Delft is a place where people can work hard, but also have time for their personal lives.
- **Increase the transparency** of the TU Delft by ensuring that all employees have access to information about the university and its policies.
- **Promote diversity and inclusion** by ensuring that all employees feel welcome and valued at the TU Delft.
- **Support career development** by ensuring that all employees have access to the resources and opportunities they need to grow and succeed in their careers.
- **Advocate for sustainability** by ensuring that the TU Delft is a leader in sustainable practices and that all employees have the opportunity to contribute to a more sustainable future.

If you have any questions or would like to get involved, please reach out to current YRI / OR member [Wo Meijer](https://www.tudelft.nl/io/over-io/personen/meijer-w) - w.i.m.t.meijer [at] tudelft.nl.
