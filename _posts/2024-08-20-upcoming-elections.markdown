There will be elections for at least **7** PhD candidate seats in the OR on the **1st and 2nd of April 2025**! This means there is a chance for passionate PhDs to work towards a better TU Delft!

If you're interested reach out to current YRI / OR member [Wo Meijer](https://www.tudelft.nl/io/over-io/personen/meijer-w) - w.i.m.t.meijer [at] tudelft.nl

### Dates

- October _TBD_, 2024: information session
- March 4, 2025: deadline to register with a faction (do this by reaching out to that fraction)
- April 1 & 2, 2025: election day

### Requirements

There is only one hard requirement:

- be employed by the TU Delft directly (not external PhD) for at least 6 months prior to the elections, i.e. 1st of October 2024

However, it is important that candidates have the time, enthusiasm, and motivation to represent the employees of the TU Delft.

### Role

Being on the works council means that you represent the employees of the TU Delft in important matters such as social safety, working conditions, future growth, and sustainability. This means you:

- Work together with other OR members to provide input and vote on TU Delft policies.
- Use your position to promote and propose measures that benefit employees.
- Monitor activities of the TU Delft to ensure compliance.
- Focus on specific issues as a member of a sub-committee.

Practically, the workload averages to 1 day a week (some weeks more time, some weeks less) on Thursdays. PhD candidates will be compensated with a **4 month extension of their contract**.

#### The OR

The OR is a functionary body of the TU Delft, there is a [rich description of what the role of the OR is on the TU Delft Intranet](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/-/works-council). The OR is a body that is consulted by the Executive Board on a wide range of topics, such as the budget, the annual report, the strategic plan, and the policy on social safety. The OR has the right to advise on these topics and can also propose its own initiatives. The OR is also involved in the appointment of new members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board.
