There will be elections for at least **7** PhD candidate seats in the OR on the **1st and 2nd of April 2025**! This means there is a chance for passionate PhDs to work towards a better TU Delft!

If you're interested reach out to current YRI / OR member [Wo Meijer](https://www.tudelft.nl/io/over-io/personen/meijer-w) - w.i.m.t.meijer [at] tudelft.nl

### Dates

- October _TBD_, 2024: information session
- March 4, 2025: deadline to register with a faction
- April 1 & 2, 2025: election day

### Requirements

There is only one hard requirement:

- be employed by the TU Delft directly (not external PhD) for at least 6 months, i.e. 1st of October 2024

However, it is important that candidates have the time, enthusiasm, and motivation to represent the employees of the TU Delft.

### Role

Being on the works council means that you represent the employees of the TU Delft in important matters such as social safety, working conditions, future growth, and sustainability. This means you:

- Work together with other OR members to provide input and vote on TU Delft policies.
- Use your position to promote and propose measures that benefit employees.
- Monitor activities of the TU Delft to ensure compliance.
- Focus on specific issues as a member of a sub-committee.

Practically, the workload averages to 1 day a week (some weeks more time, some weeks less) mainly on Thursdays. PhD candidates will be compensated with a 4 month extension of their contract.
