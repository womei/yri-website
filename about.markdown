## What is the Works Council?

The Works Council (in Dutch "Ondernemingsraad" or OR) is a body of elected employees that represents the interests of all employees of the TU Delft. The OR has the right to advise and approve on a wide range of topics such as working conditions, social safety, and future growth. The OR is also responsible for monitoring the activities of the TU Delft to ensure compliance with the law and agreements. The OR is composed of 25 members and meets twice a month, once internally and once with the Executive Board of the university. Additionally there ar several sub-committees that focus on specific topics such as working conditions, sustainability, and future growth.
